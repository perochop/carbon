# Accordion
Group, hide and show content.

## Overview
Accordions are a good progressive disclosure technique - initially showing only top-level information, but allowing the user quick access to more on request. But, they can confuse users sometimes, so use them sparingly.

## Quick Start

To use accordion, import the `Accordion` and pass the content as children.

It can be used as a controlled component where the expansion state is controlled externally,
in that case both `onChange` and `expanded` props are required.

```jsx
import Accordion from "carbon-react/lib/components/accordion"

const MyComponent = () => (
  <Accordion onChange={ onChange } expanded={ expanded } title="Title">
    <p>Content as a children</p>
  </Accordion>
);
```

It can also be used as an uncontrolled component where the expansion state is controlled internally.
It is still possible to pass `onChange` to hook a callback for state changes, however to set initial expansion state `defaultExpanded` can be passed.

```jsx
import Accordion from "carbon-react/lib/components/accordion"

const MyComponent = () => (
  <Accordion onChange={ onChange } defaultExpanded={ true } title="Title">
    <p>Content as a children</p>
  </Accordion>
);
```
