# Designer Notes
- An accordion gives users control over how much content they want to see, and allows them to find the content they need quickly.

- Accordions are a good progressive disclosure technique - initially showing only top-level information, but allowing the user quick access to more on request.

- Don’t put accordions within accordions.

- Don’t hide important controls within accordions - for example, primary actions should always be outside them.

- Accordions expand and collapse vertically. If there are lots, or content is extensive, be careful that the user doesn’t become confused, lose their place, or have problems with discoverability. Use them sparingly for these reasons.

- Accordions should remain open or closed until a user interacts with them. Consider whether multiple, or only one accordion section can be open at a time.

- An arrow icon pointing down indicates that the accordion is closed.

- An arrow icon pointing up indicates that the accordion is open.

- The icon can animate when a transition is made.

- The user can click the icon directly, the text label, or the text label’s background to action the accordion.
